I’m sorry to hear that the invoice you received appears to be incorrect, and I understand how important it is to have accurate billing information, especially on short notice.\n\n**What I’ll do next**\n\n1. **Review the invoice** – I have already forwarded the details you provided to our Billing Team.  \n2. **Identify the discrepancy** – To pinpoint the issue quickly, could you please share one or more of the following (whichever is most convenient):\n   * The invoice number (e.g., INV‑2025‑00456)  \n   * The date the invoice was issued  \n   * The specific line‑item(s) or amount(s) that look incorrect  \n   * Any supporting documents (e.g., a purchase order or a screenshot of the invoice)\n\n3. **Correct and re‑issue** – Once we confirm the error, we will issue a revised invoice and send it to you within **4 business hours**. If a credit or adjustment is required, it will be reflected on the new document.\n\n**Our standard invoicing policy**  \nAccording to our Billing Documentation (Section 3.2 – “Invoice Corrections”), any billing error reported within 30 days will be corrected at no additional charge, and an updated invoice will be emailed to the original recipient. This ensures that your records stay accurate and that any downstream processes (e.g., payment approvals) are not delayed.\n\n**While we work on the fix**\n\n* If you have any pending payment deadlines that might be impacted, please let us know so we can note the situation with our Finance Department and avoid any late‑payment fees.  \n* Should you need a temporary proof‑of‑service or a statement of account, I can generate one for you right away.\n\nI understand this is urgent, and I’ll keep you updated on our progress. Expect a follow‑up from me by **12:00 PM (your local time) today** with either the corrected invoice or a request for the additional details listed above.\n\nThank you for your patience and for giving us the opportunity to resolve this promptly.
