The source code is split between the front-end, agent, and services though services have not yet been implemented.

`front-end` builds the streamlit front end but the code is in streamlit-ui

`multi-agent-system` builds the agentic system

`services` are not yet implemented but connect the system to mail services and ofther integrations.
